# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-course-project-LM
Repository that includes the material for the final assignment of the course "Getting and Cleaning data"

1. CodeBookLM.md is a code book that includes the data link for downloading and the name of the folder. Then it describes the variables and the transformations that I performed to clean up the data.

2. run_analysis.R includes the code used to fullfill specific indications:
   
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  This also includes the command to save the final/clean data as a table

4. final_data.txt includes the table with the clean data
